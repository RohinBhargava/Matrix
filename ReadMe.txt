Hello friend!

In this folder, you will find the reproduction of Brown Computer Science Professor, Philip Klein's Coursera course,"Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications" for the summer of 2013. Before delving into the exciting contents of this folder, I will first explain to you how I have set it up.
 
Inside the main folder, entitled "Matrix" (where you are probably reading this file), you will find a folder entitled "Recyclable Codes". In this folder, you will find a series of files with .py and .pyc extensions. These files are compiled and run through the programming language "Python", which we will be using for the course. Here is a link to the download of the python version we will be using: 'http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.0/'. The files found in the "Recyclable Codes" are either downloaded from the website 'http://www.resources.codingthematrix.com' or created by me, and are included for easy access when you need to import certain pre-coded modules into the assignment you are working on (if this doesn't make sense to you, it will after you complete the first couple of assignments).

The next set of items you will see in the main "Matrix" folder are subfolders with the composition "Week x" (where x is a number). These are a rough guideline for the pacing of the course and correspond to the Coursera course's pacing. Inside each of these "Week" folders, you will find two subfolders - "Assignments" and "Videos". The "Assignments" folder contains that week's assignments, and the "Videos" folder contains that week's videos. It is crucial that you finish the week's assignments, but not that you watch each of the week's videos.

In the "Assignments" folder, you will find "Assignment x" subfolders (where x is a number and a description), which hold another two subfolders - "Complete" and "Stencil". You should start with the "Stencil", and open the .pdf file. This will be where you find the details for the assignment. Right click on the assignment with the .py extension (not the submit assignment file) and click "Edit with Idle", which will open an editable python file, and code away!

When you think you have finished the assignment, save your work, try some test cases, and debug. Then, open the "Complete" folder within the assignment's folder and check your work against the file with the assignment's name (also editable in Idle). There may be slight variations, but if your code works, you're set! Check 'http://www.codingthematrix.com' to see if Mr. Klein has put up a set of autograders if you would prefer to correct your work like that instead (but as of the end of the summer 2013 course, he has not). Also available on his site is his book for purchase, with explanations and more practice problems for the topics included in this course and more!

Now that that's out of the way, click on "Week 0" and you may begin however you want to!

Enjoy,

P.S. I have included an 'errata' file above which shows errors in the course.
